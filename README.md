# boston_housing

## Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Project 1

In this project, you will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. You will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, you will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. You will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable you to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, you will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

### Install
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (v0.17)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).


### Code
This project contains three files:

- boston_housing.ipynb  
  This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- housing.csv: The project dataset  
  You’ll load this data in the notebook.
- visuals.py  
  This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
  
### Run
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command:  
```jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb```
